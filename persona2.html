            <h2>Back Story</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>    Finding her passion in her family full of Computer Scientists, she learned from a early age how systems work, and how they can be broken, as she'd look for ways to break into her families computers and technology, in order to prank them. Learning through high school, then majoring in Computer Science, she became fascinated by ethical hacking and network vulnerabilities. After complete internships with multiple small companies and private firms, she quickly landed her first job as a junior analyst at a cybersecurity company. Where she used her sharp problem-solving skills, relentless attention to detail, and ability to stay calm during cyber attacks.</li>

            <h2>Frustrations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>    Bailey hates dealing with users who ignore basic security protocols, like using weak passwords. As well as dealing with endless false positives from automated threat detection systems, and trying to convince upper management to invest in better security measures.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Motivations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>    Bailey is passionate in protecting sensitive information, riven by the responsibility of safeguarding personal and financial data from cybercriminals, knowing her work protects peopleâ€™s privacy. She loves the challenge of outsmarting hackers and cyber attackers, finding it rewarding to stay one step ahead of evolving threats, and most of all, she loves making a real-world impact, knowing her efforts in protecting people.</li>

Regularly updating software and installing security patches without delay is crucial, as it helps Sophia focus on advanced threats rather than preventable vulnerabilities. She also values customers who are open to security training and education, understanding the importance of staying informed about phishing scams and suspicious online activity.</li>
